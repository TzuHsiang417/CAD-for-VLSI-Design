# Assignment 2 Resource Constrained Scheduler
Due to hardware constraints, graph scheduling must take into account the resource usage within each state while simultaneously minimizing latency. The objective of this assignment is to design an algorithm that schedules a Data Flow Graph (DFG) under resource constraints.
