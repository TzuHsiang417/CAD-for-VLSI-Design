# Assignment 3 Logic Optimization
The objective of logic optimization is to improve a given combinational circuit in terms of performance or area, in order to meet design constraints. This process facilitates effective technology mapping by transforming Boolean networks—often in a non-circuit form—into optimized circuit implementations that satisfy specified cost and constraint requirements.
