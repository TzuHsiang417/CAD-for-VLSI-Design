# Assignment 1 Verilog Generator
The Verilog generator plays a crucial role in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools by enabling the automatic conversion of benchmark files into Verilog descriptions, thereby facilitating subsequent logic synthesis and verification processes. In this project, we aimed to implement a Verilog generator using C or C++. Given a `.bench` file as input, the tool is designed to parse the circuit information and generate an equivalent Verilog representation, ensuring compatibility with standard digital design flows.
